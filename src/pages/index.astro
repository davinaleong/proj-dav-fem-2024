			<p>
				Here is a collection of my submissions for the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a> challenges. I noticed I was doing backend work in my day job, so I used my free time to tackle these frontend projects. I always aim to be well-rounded. My motto for these projects was to keep it raw and straightforward--meaning pure HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript. No fancy stuff like jQuery, React or SASS. This also allowed me to explore new native features like the HTML dialogue element and container queries.
